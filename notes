- ADO.NET Application
- Connected Architecture
- Disconnected Architecture
- using stored procedure
- Implicit transaction
- Master - detail relationship
- Data binding

ADO.NET :

- Active database objects
- interact with other data sources xml,sql,text...
- Allow to connect with underlying data or database
- It has classes and methods that allow us to manipulate the data and retrive the data from database

Connected Architecture :

- Connection is open throughout the processing

Disconnected Architectute :

- The application automatically connect & disconnects during the processing.
- The application uses temporary data on the application side called as DATA SET


Classes :

- Connection class : Connect to the database

sqlconnection conobj=new sqlconnection("data provider = servername,databasename,userid,pwd,security");

- Command class : execute the sql command

insert,update,delete,select

sqlcommand cmd=new sqlcommand("select * from gaming");

- DataReader class : Must be used while working with select command / reading the data

methods :

- Execute reader : reads the data 

				datareader dr=cmd.executereader()
		
- ExecuteNonQuery : Work with create,insert,update,delete commands

					cmd.executenonquery();

- Executescalar : this method returns single value

					cmd=select * from avgSalary() 

					cmd.executescalar();

- ExecuteXMLReader : return an xml object 

Data Adapter class : creates the connection , manages the connection between database and application

Data Set class : Dataset is a collection of tables.Whenever command executes,it will fetch the tables,rows,columns from the dataset
					rather than database .




Stored procedure : Prevents sql injection on your code
