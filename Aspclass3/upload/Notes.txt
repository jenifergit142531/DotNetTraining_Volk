1.Data Chache
2.Output cache
3.Partial cache

- Paging in detail view
- File Upload
- Data Pager
- Form View
- Tree view
- SiteMapPath


State management :

- Browsers are by default is stateless
- HTTP Protocol to render the page on the brower
- This HTTP - Hyper text transfer protocol is stateless(just cleans up the resource)
- State managemnt techniques will allow you to store the state of the page,objects,session id,data,url info ...in some specific location

Client side SM:

- the state related info will get stored on the client side.
- This specific info will travel back and communicate with every request given  by the user.

Server side SM :

- all the info are stored in the memory.
- More secure in nature 

View State :

- Page level SM
- Used to hold the data temp
- Can store any data type
- Property dependent 

Querystring :

- Hold data from different page
- Pass info from one page to another or the same page also

? [querystring]

Cookies : 

- small text that is stored on the client browser.

1.persistent : cookies end based on the expiration date

2.Nonpersistent : this gets stored as long as the user access or uses the service.



Server side SM :

- Application - one app state across the application
- Session - seperate session created for every request

Cache :

Frequently made request is processed and stored on the memory


Types :

1.Page caching
2.Data caching
3.Fragment caching 

Page Caching : Caching the entire page

<% OutputCache Duration=5 VaryByParam="ID"%>

* = cache all the parameters 
none  = do not cache parameter


Data Cache :

set EnableCaching="true" CacheDuration=10 on the data source control 

Fragment Caching :Partial page caching - caches part of the page


File Upload :
