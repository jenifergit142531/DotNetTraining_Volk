Transaction :

- Logical\ single unit of work (mutiple action / activity)

Properties :

ACID
A - Atomicity - Either all operation will work or none of it will work 
C - Consistency - DB changes state upon commit transaction
I - Isolation - independent transactions
D - Durability - Ensure data persistence in case of system failure 

- TransactionScope class - runs multiple activities in the given environment
- SQLTransaction class

WPF : windows presentation foundation  

- building windows application
- Its a wrapper(Managed and unmanaged code)


Windows : C# language (GUI & Behaviour in same language)
WPF : GUI (XAML), behaviour (C# code) 

XAML :

 <Button Click="Button_Click" Background="{DynamicResource {x:Static SystemColors.ControlBrushKey}}" BorderBrush="#FFC52714" BorderThickness="11,15,11,15" FontFamily="Calibri" FontSize="24" Margin="420,263,258,185">Click</Button>


 C# : 

 private void Button_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
        {
            MessageBox.Show("Hello welcome");
        }



        WPF Forms :

        * right click application and add references

        System.windows.forms
        windowsformsintegration


   WCF : Windows communication foundation

   - Helps to create a distributed service oriented technology
   - Create a distributed architecture 
   - a single service will interact with different client by using endpoints


   Endpoints :

   - ABC 

   Address : where the service is residing in the network
   Binding :how the service interact with the application
   Contract : what service will do 

   [ServiceContract] - interface
   [OperationContract] - methods
   [DataContract] - class
   [DataMember] - data fields
   [FaultContract] - Exception handling

   Workflow :

   - Series of activities involved in a task
   - Except for first and last step , every steps will have a preceding and succeeding steps

   Types :

   - sequence
   - Flowchart
   - State 

   What is an activity :

   - Piece of work
   - simple / complex
   - Activities forms the fundamental building block of workflow
   - represents an action in the workflow

   Rules and conditions :

   Condition - if logic is true or false
             - if else branching

   Rules - Contains multiple conditions with a set of actions to perform

   Workflows ??

   - System management
   - Rules driven workflows
   - Document centric
   

   XCOPY Deployment :

   CMD Prompt :

cd /

C:\>xcopy /i /s C:\Users\JeniferY\May_Vd\Class10\WCFClientApp c:\xcopyfolder

Click Once deployment : publish
