ASP.Net web form model :

- event driven model of interaction to the web application
- submit the web form to the server and server provides the response 


ASP.NET Lifecycle :

1. Application Life cycle

application start --->run multiple web forms --> application stop

2. Page Life cycle [request --->response]

Stages in the lifecycle :

page request : Request is made to the server
Page initialization : Each request is marked with unique id and processed
page load : start the page level execution
validation : check the data enterd is valid or not
postback event handling :  event handler is invoked
page rendereing : Response is created and rendered on the client
page unload :clean up the resources(db connection,file open..)


Events :

1.PreInit() :first event in the page lifecycle.
It will check for the IsPostBacK property

2.Init() - Initializt the control property 
textbox1.text=""

3.InitComplete() = Allow the view state tracking

4.LoadViewState() = Load View state information

5.LoadPostData() = the contents of all the input field are defines

6.PreLoad() = Preload occurs before the post back data is loaded in the control.

7.Load() = Load your page

8.LoadComplete() = page validation,dependencies are loaded allong with the page for execution

9.PreRender() = Happens before the actual output is shown on the browser

10. PreRenderComplete() - Called for all the child controls

11.SaveStateComplete() = state of the control is saved.

12.UnLoad() - Last phase in the page life cycle.Final clean will be done.
